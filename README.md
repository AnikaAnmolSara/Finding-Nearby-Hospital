Finding the Nearest Hospital using the shortest route 

This project focuses on locating the nearest hospital from your current position.
The implementation primarily utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm, DFS, and hashing techniques. 
Through these methodologies, the system efficiently navigates through given location data to identify the closest medical facility.
